# Challenge1-refactoring-horiseon-webpage

## Description 

This reposiitory was created to rewrite the Horiseon webpage code to include semantic elements in the HTMl and clean us the CSS style sheet using proper classes and id's. It solves the problem of the Horiseon webpage's lack of semantic elements and accessibility as well as cleaning up repeating code on the CSS side. I learned the importance of the use of semantic HTML elements for accessibility as well as condensing code in CSS using classes/id's to not have repeating code and to keep things clean also.
